Dataset for CS601R
==================
This package contains the dataset used for the first project in CS 601R.
This package should only be used for learning purposes, and the datasets involved should not be used for
commercial purposes without prior permission of the dataset creators.

The butterfly images in this package come from the Leeds Butterfly Dataset, obtained from http://www.josiahwang.com/dataset/leedsbutterfly/.
This dataset comes as part of the following work:

Josiah Wang, Katja Markert, and Mark Everingham
Learning Models for Object Recognition from Natural Language Descriptions
In Proceedings of the 20th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC2009)

The images in this dataset have been resized from the original dataset to a max width of 500 pixels.
